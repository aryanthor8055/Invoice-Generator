An Invoice creator project built with React. Add itemized items, configure quantity, prices, tax rates and discounts. Download Invoice as PDFs to your device. Created Invoice Lists and use redux for persist states. Uses [jspdf-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-react) to capture the data from the modal and covert it from canvas -> pdf.
